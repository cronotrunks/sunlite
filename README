   moreover names instruction on channel in that window :)

   automatically).

   automatically too).

 Tban ( Alt + b ) - It bans and kicks nicks in active channel and shows
   an output default message or another wich you can include in arguments.
   It's based on an aditional feature which is a bans counter.

   when someone mention us in a channel ( based on notices ).

 Conference ( Alt + c ) - Exclusive mode in our script :) It can be used
   to talk in a channel which pepole is joining and parting permanently
   and we can't read the conversation cleanly. It's very useful when there
   is a conference in a channel ;)

   in BitchX environment ;)

 Snapshot (Alt + s ) - It's a fun utility which is used to take a snapshot 
   of the BitchX screen.

   command line. You'll need to have installed on your system the esms
   program (in debian sid -> apt-get install esms -if it doesn't work in 
   your region, you can change it. Edit the code-).

   It support song lists, ask for them ( '/mp3 list' ), and we can play all 
   the files in directory with special chars - i.e. '/mp3 play */*' - '/mp3 
   help' for more help. 

 Cd - It also is used to listen to music on BitchX environment, but now in cd

   information will be report from cddb. '/cd help' for more help.

   in a graphical browser, we needn't to write it in a note. Run '/termx text' and 
   this text will be send to the first X terminal on XFree86.

 Traducir - From now you'll can talk in spanish channels easier. You only
   have to type '/translate spanish word' and the script will tell you the
   correct word in spanish language.

 Notification: With ( Alt + q ) hot-key, we can change between main and
   query windows and furthermore ( Alt + w ) hot-key is used to go to next
   window and ( Alt + e ) to go to previous window. ( Alt + z ) hot-key is
   used to close the active window.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We can also tell you this script possesses anti-flood protections, 
   anti-ctcp's, anti-deops, anti-bans ( in channels we have enough level), ...
   
 It also contains themes for a more friendly BitchX using. The modifications
   which I have made in the script are only aesthetics. It hasn't colours
   default because the most doesn't like it.

 On connect to IRC, this script identifies ourselves automatically. 

 Its eurocalculator service is enabled for all the users on the net thru ctcp 
   commands ( '/ctcp our_nick euro amount' from euros to pesetas and '/ctcp
   our_nick peseta amount' from pesetas to euros ) 

 Added a fortune service based on ctcp's. It's enabled with '/ctcp nuestro_nick 
   fortune #canal' command.

 All the ctcp's Todos los servicios ctcp's tienen protección anti-flood

 Added a new function with sounds events (it enables thru a variable in config
   file). .wav files are taken from another spanish scripts in first, but 
   step to step they will be change ;) We need bplay package to listen these
   sounds ( debian users must run : apt-get install bplay ) :)

 Added a new option for enabling/disabling Autojoin and TimeStamp, moreover
   another option to open queries on first private message automatically with
   a new query window.
